# Audio: RDPSND, AAC, mute-on-minimize, and the microphone

How system audio reaches the client, the opt-in AAC compression path, and the
minimize/refocus behavior.

System audio rides over the RDPSND virtual channel as 16-bit stereo PCM at **44.1 kHz**. ScreenCaptureKit only supports 8 / 16 / 24 / 48 kHz, so the capture loop captures at 48 kHz and resamples to 44.1 with [`rubato`](https://github.com/HEnquist/rubato) before sending. The 44.1 kHz output is empirically load-bearing — the earlier 48 kHz feed over-fed mstsc into multi-second backlogs, and 44.1 fixed it (the precise mechanism is a pacing/rate-accounting effect; Windows resamples shared-mode streams to the endpoint mix format either way). A generation counter on the audio factory keeps a client reconnect from leaving a second capture loop feeding the channel. The vendored `ironrdp-server` carries a single patch that makes `dispatch_server_events` keep the *newest* queued waves on per-batch overflow instead of the oldest — without it, a one-off video-encode stall would bake a permanent audio-latency offset into the session.

The capture loop also **self-heals a dead SCK audio stream**: over a long session ScreenCaptureKit can stop delivering samples or transiently fail to start, which previously left the connection silent for the rest of the session (video is a separate stream and kept running). The loop now rebuilds the audio `SCStream` with capped exponential backoff (250 ms → 5 s) on both start failures and mid-stream end, resetting the backoff once a sample arrives; the generation guard still retires it on reconnect, so there's no double-capture.

**Only when the client asks for it.** The client says where it wants the audio in its Client Info PDU (mstsc: Local Resources → Remote audio → "Play on this computer" / "Play on remote computer" / "Do not play"; FreeRDP: `/audio-mode:0|1|2`). The server starts RDPSND, and so the audio capture, only for "Play on this computer". For the other two it logs `Client asked for no audio playback, rdpsnd not started` and nothing is captured or sent (vendored divergence (31)). "Play on remote computer" means the Mac speakers: the server does not change the Mac audio output, so the Mac plays as it did before the session.

**AAC compression** (opt-in, `--enable-aac`). By default audio is uncompressed PCM (~1.4 Mbit/s). Pass `--enable-aac` to encode it as **AAC-LC** over RDPSND (`WAVE_FORMAT_AAC_MS`, ~128 kbps by default — about 11x smaller), which matters over WAN or constrained links. The encoder is AudioToolbox (software AAC-LC); the wire payload is raw AAC access units. The server advertises AAC ahead of PCM, so clients that decode it (mstsc, Microsoft Remote Desktop / Windows App, FreeRDP built with AAC support) negotiate AAC automatically while clients without it fall back to PCM transparently. It's off by default because AAC adds ~40–50 ms of encoder priming latency — on a LAN, PCM's zero added latency is the better default. Tune the bitrate with `--aac-bitrate` (default `128000`; `96000` saves the most bandwidth, `192000` is near-transparent for music).

**Mute on minimize** (default-on, opt out with `--no-mute-on-minimize`). When the client minimizes its window it sends the standard `SuppressOutput { None }` PDU; the server stops emitting both EGFX video frames and RDPSND waves until the client refocuses (`RefreshRectangle` / `SuppressOutput { Some(rect) }`). Without this, mstsc accumulates a backlog of video frames + audio waves during a long minimize that has to chew through on refocus, producing several seconds of input lockout, audio drift, and a video catch-up storm. With it, you get a brief audio gap on refocus and audio + video resume in sync. Both gates are debounced (1 s) so transient `SuppressOutput` flaps mstsc emits under wire pressure (e.g., during a heavy local `cargo build`) don't oscillate the mute and cause stutter. Pass `--no-mute-on-minimize` if you specifically want audio to keep playing while the client window is minimized — accepting that audio will drift by however long was spent minimized.

## Microphone redirection (experimental)

The other direction: **the client's microphone becomes a real input device on
the Mac**, "macrdp Microphone", which Zoom, FaceTime, QuickTime and Teams can
record from. Off by default; turn it on with `--enable-microphone-redirection`
(config `ENABLE_MICROPHONE_REDIRECTION=1`, or the controller's Settings →
Redirection → Microphone toggle).

**Setup, once:** install the "macrdp Microphone" driver from the menu-bar
controller — Settings → Redirection → Microphone → **Install macrdp
Microphone…**. It asks for an administrator password and restarts Core Audio,
which briefly interrupts sound. The same place shows when a newer macrdp bundles
a newer driver (**Update…**) and removes it (**Remove…**). Without a controller,
run `/Applications/macrdp.app/Contents/Resources/install-audio-plugin.sh`.

**On the client:** mstsc → Local Resources → Remote audio → Settings →
**Record from this computer**, set before connecting. FreeRDP: `/microphone`.

**What to expect:** the device carries the client's audio with about 100 ms of
latency, and reads as silence when no session is streaming. After a network
stall it skips ahead to stay current rather than playing late audio, which can
cause a brief click.

**Limits:**
- **Other people's accounts on this Mac can listen in** while a session is
  streaming. They can't inject audio, and nothing is kept after the session ends.
  On a Mac with other user accounts, treat an active redirected mic as audible to
  them. (Why: `docs/macos-gotchas.md`, item 5.)
- **44.1 kHz only for now** (16-bit PCM). mstsc offers it. A client that can't
  gets no mic, and macrdp logs why.

**Debugging:** `MIC_DUMP=1` in `config.env` (env `MACRDP_MIC_DUMP=1`) writes
the received audio to a WAV file under `$TMPDIR` instead of feeding the device —
play it back to check what the client actually sent.
